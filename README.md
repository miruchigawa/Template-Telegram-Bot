# TEMPLATE TELEGRAM BOT

## Support

Before requesting support, you should know that this template requires you to have at least a **basic knowledge** of
Python and the library is made for advanced users. Do not use this template if you don't know the
basics. [Here's](https://docs.python.org/3/) a link for document to learn Python.

If you have questions, please give a question to. [Here's](https://chat.whatsapp.com/LuqVaZWIqhpAJPnSkgOEOV)
## Disclaimer
This is a basic template alone requires the addition of the code in it to work normally.

## How to set up

To set up the bot I made it as simple as possible. I now created a [config.json](data/config.json) file where you can put the
needed things to edit.

Here is an explanation of what everything is:

| Variable                  | What it is                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TOKEN_BOT       | The token of your bot                                                 |

## How to start

To start the bot you simply need to launch, either your terminal (Linux, Mac & Windows), or your Command Prompt (
Windows)
.

Before running the bot you will need to install all the requirements with this command:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
and
```
$ python main.py
```
or
```
$ python3 main.py
```
To start
